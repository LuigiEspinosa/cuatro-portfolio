# Deferred work

Findings surfaced incidentally by a build run, real but not caused by the story that
found them. Append only. Each entry names the spec that surfaced it.

- source_spec: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/spec-1-2-external-uptime-and-certificate-age-monitoring.md`
  summary: >-
    `cuatro.dev` is not serving the Anchor. It presents a self-signed
    `CN=TRAEFIK DEFAULT CERT` and returns 404 at `/api/health`, so every browser
    gets a TLS error page.
  evidence: |-
    Observed 2026-08-16 from outside the VPS, and independently re-verified in the
    main session by direct TLS handshake. `cuatro.dev` resolves to `95.216.143.251`
    through both the local resolver and `1.1.1.1`. Port 443 completes a handshake
    presenting subject and issuer `CN=TRAEFIK DEFAULT CERT`, notBefore
    2026-08-15T19:21:43Z, notAfter 2027-08-15T19:21:43Z, sole SAN under
    `.traefik.default`, so validation fails for any ordinary client. Behind it,
    `/api/health` returns `404 page not found`. `analytics.cuatro.dev` is on the same
    address with the same certificate. The three satellite hostnames are healthy on
    valid 90-day Let's Encrypt certificates. This violates NFR-2, nothing live may
    break, and it is the Anchor, the one hostname FR-18 and SM-6 are measured on. It
    is not this story's work to fix and this story changed nothing on the box, but
    nothing in the repository will notice it until Story 1.2's Operator actions are
    performed.

- source_spec: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/spec-1-2-external-uptime-and-certificate-age-monitoring.md`
  summary: >-
    The estate does not serve from one address, which the AGENTS.md "one Hetzner
    box" framing and Story 1-7's routing enumeration both assume.
  evidence: |-
    Observed 2026-08-16. `cuatro.dev` and `analytics.cuatro.dev` resolve to
    `95.216.143.251`; `cs-tracker.cuatro.dev`, `tracker.cuatro.dev` and
    `library.cuatro.dev` resolve to `177.7.52.248`. A Traefik is answering on the
    first address, while Epic 4 is where Caddy is supposed to be replaced by Traefik,
    so either something has moved ahead of the plan or a box was rebuilt. This does
    not change the monitoring decision, since UptimeRobot sits outside both, but
    Story 1-7 enumerates a routing table that is now known to span two addresses, and
    Epic 4's rebuild topology assumes one.

- source_spec: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/spec-1-2-external-uptime-and-certificate-age-monitoring.md`
  summary: >-
    AD-17a has no mechanical enforcement. The gate exists only as prose in a file
    that no script, workflow or source file reads.
  evidence: |-
    `ops/monitoring.md` is referenced by nothing in the repository except its own
    spec, and `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs typecheck and vitest only. Stories
    1-10, 1-11, 1-14 and 2.23 are each expected to read one line in that file before
    enabling automation, but a story can add a CI job while the line still reads
    `not-satisfied` and no command in the repository would fail. Either the gate
    needs a check that reads the line, or the epic should state that it is an
    honour-system gate. This is an architectural question spanning several stories,
    not a defect in this record.

- source_spec: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/spec-1-2-external-uptime-and-certificate-age-monitoring.md`
  summary: >-
    `app/api/health/route.ts` is now a monitored contract, and neither the route nor
    its tests know it.
  evidence: |-
    `ops/monitoring.md` directs the monitor to assert the literal substring
    `"status":"ok"` against the serialized response body. The route's tests at
    `app/api/health/__tests__/route.test.ts:4-8` mock `next/server` so
    `NextResponse.json` becomes `(body) => ({ json: async () => body })`, and the
    assertions inspect the plain object. Serialization is therefore never observed by
    any test. Pretty-printing, an envelope wrapper, or middleware reshaping would
    keep all three tests green while the substring disappears from the wire, and the
    monitor would report the Anchor down while it is healthy. A comment on the route
    and a test asserting the serialized form would close it. Left out of this story
    because its task list is confined to `ops/monitoring.md`.
